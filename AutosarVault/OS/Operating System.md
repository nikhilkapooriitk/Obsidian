Interface between user and hardware. 

Major uses:
1. Resource management -> single server handling multiple users, convenience of using hardware
2. Process management -> decides which tasks to run on the cpu
3. Storage management -> how, where to store data permanently on disk
4. Memory management -> Loading, unloading of RAM
5. Security -> Stores password securely, blocks one process in RAM trying to access other processes

##### Types of OS
1. **Batch Operating System** ->(FORTRAN, IBSYS809x) Old system; Load job to punch cards, give to operator, make batches of similar type of tasks, he'll run; non-preemptive jobs; CPU idle high as jobs wait for IO ![[chmodImage.png]]
2. **Multi programmed  OS** -> Non-Preemptive; Focus on completing the task completely, no Idleness; If task require IO then that task's state is saved and and removed from the CPU and after IO added to process queue.
3. **Multi tasking OS** ->(Windows) Pre-emptive; Focus on fair resource management to all process, responsive OS; 
4. Real time OS (RTOS)
5. Distributed
6. Clustered
7. Embedded
